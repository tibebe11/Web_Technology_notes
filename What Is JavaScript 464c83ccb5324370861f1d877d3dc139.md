## **Reason to Learn JavaScript**

JavaScript is used by many developers (65% of the total development community), and the number is increasing day by day. JavaScript is one such programming language that has more than 1444231 libraries and increasing rapidly. It is preferred over any other programming language by most developers. Also, major tech companies like Microsoft, Uber, Google, Netflix, and Meta use JavaScript in their projects.

## **Things that makes JavaScript demanding**

JavaScript is the most popular and hence the most loved language around the globe. Apart from this, there are abundant reasons to become the most demanding. Below are a listing of a few important points:

- **No need for compilers:** Since JavaScript is an interpreted language, therefore it does not need any compiler for compilation.
- **Used both Client and Server Side:** Earlier JavaScript was used to build client-side applications only, but with the evolution of its frameworks namely Node.js and Express.js, it is now widely used for building server-side applications too.
- **Helps to build a complete solution:** As we saw, JavaScript is widely used in both client and server-side applications, therefore it helps us to build an end-to-end solution to a given problem.
- **Used everywhere:** JavaScript is so loved because it can be used anywhere. It can be used to develop websites, games or mobile apps, etc.
- **Huge community support:** JavaScript has a huge community of users and mentors who love this language and take it’s legacy forward.

# **JavaScript Where To**

## The <script> Tag

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between `<script>` and `</script>` tags.

## JavaScript in <head> or <body>

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the `<body>`, or in the `<head>` section of an HTML page, or in both.

## **External JavaScript**

Scripts can also be placed in external files:

External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension **.js**.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the `src` (source) attribute of a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

You can place an external script reference in `<head>` or `<body>` as you like.

The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the `<script>` tag is located.

External scripts cannot contain `<script>` tags.

# External JavaScript Advantages

Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

- It separates HTML and code
- It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
- Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:

```html
<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
<script src="myScript2.js"></script>
```
